Winthrop, 1943.515Provenance: Mrs. J. van Gogh-Bonger, Amsterdam; K. Fahraeus, Lidingö-Brevik, 1911; Thorsten Laurin, Stockholm; art market, Paris; Grenville L. WinthropIn August 1888, van Gogh wrote his brother Theo from Arles (where he lived from February 1888 to May 1890) of a just-completed painting of a local peasant: “You are shortly to make the acquaintance of Master Patience Escalier, a sort of ‘man with a hoe,’ formerly cowherd of the Camargue, now gardener at a house in the Crau.”(1) He added, “I imagine the man I have to paint, terrible in the furnace of the height of harvest-time. Hence the orange colors flashing like lightning, vivid as red-hot iron, and hence the luminous tones of old gold in the shadows. Oh, my dear boy  and the nice people will only see the exaggeration as a caricature.” At about the same time, he sent Theo the Fogg drawing, which he had executed after finishing the painting.(2)The drawing served several purposes. On one level, van Gogh intended to give Theo a sense of the painting. Moreover, the finished quality of the execution, the sheet’s large size, and van Gogh’s signature suggest he envisioned it for the market, in keeping perhaps with the promise made to his brother some months before to focus more on drawing than on painting in order to increase his production and potential sales. On another level, the drawing was an important part of the process by which van Gogh came to understand and explore a motif. The Fogg drawing does not reproduce the painting but instead interprets and revises it, as many of his drawings after paintings do. In the painting, Escalier’s face is more angular and rugged, his body larger and more imposing, his face slightly tilted; in the drawing, the lines of the face soften, the shoulders slope slightly, and the body leans forward. That van Gogh considered a peasant a subject worthy of portraiture — a genre ordinarily reserved for persons of stature — says much of his sympathies for the common man. Here, he strikes a balance between describing Escalier’s likeness and evoking his character. Though van Gogh’s peasant imagery was guided by the spirit of Millet, he renders not the generalized type Millet favored but an individual, recording the particulars of the physiognomy — the thin but prominent nose, wide eyes, and high cheekbones. And in contrast with the sentimental or romantic images of peasants produced by such salon artists as Jules Breton or Bastien-Lepage, he unflinchingly shows the effects of work, sun, and age on Escalier’s face — the withered brown skin, the bones pressing through the sagging flesh, the angular line of the jaw, the deep eye sockets. With his clearly delineated dark eyes looking straight ahead, Escalier’s gaze is at once dignified and kindly, steadfast but not brash. The set of his lips seems perhaps more tentative and ambiguous; in a letter to Theo in September, where the artist recounted seeing Escalier in a local café, he spoke of his difficulty in capturing the “uncertainty, weariness, and vagueness” of the peasant’s mouth.(3) In the drawing, the line describing the lower lip does fade at points, perhaps reflecting van Gogh’s indecision. Yet what he saw as a shortcoming may be a strength, since the ambiguous expression endows Escalier’s face with a sense of mystery and reserve.The rich variety of marks van Gogh uses in this work is typical of the graphic style he developed in Arles. He established the broad outlines of the figure in pencil, still visible in some passages, and then began to define the image in reed pen, varying the lines in length, density, and direction. As Nicholas Wadley has observed, the dualism that characterized his painting at this time — the desire both to be naturalistic and truthful and to use color evocatively, even if arbitrarily — shapes his drawings.(4) Now, however, the size of the mark and the thickness of the ink must do the work of color. For example, he renders Escalier’s features with finely hatched and stippled modeling but exaggerates the jagged jawline with strong, flattened contours. To express “the furnace of the height of harvest-time,” conveyed in the painting with rich, gesturally applied red-orange pigment, he fills the background with a torrent of dots which, moving in various directions, create the hallucinatory sensation of unrelenting heat.

For the painting, “Portrait of Patience Escalier,” see J.B. de la Faille, THE WORKS OF VINCENT VAN GOGH (Amsterdam, 1970), F 443.2.Letter [LT] 522, dated around 13 August 1888. Later in August he produced a second painting and a drawing of Escalier, bust-length portraits like the earlier works, though he now included the hands; F 444 and F 1461. Describing the second painting Meyer Schapiro wrote, “It is perhaps the last realistic portrait of a peasant in the tradition of western painting. It is also perhaps the only great portrait of a peasant.” Schapiro’s description applies equally to the earlier drawing.

Students from two seminars co-taught by Ewa Lajer-Burcharth, the William Dorr Boardman Professor of Fine Arts, and Elizabeth M. Rudy, the Carl A. Weyerhaeuser Associate Curator of Prints, were charged with helping organize a curricular exhibition that would illuminate drawing’s emergence into modernity over the 18th and 19th centuries. The project has yielded the exhibition Drawing: The Invention of a Modern Medium (on view at the Harvard Art Museums in the University Research and Teaching Galleries, January 21–May 7, 2017), an accompanying catalogue, and a digital tool.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGraduate students who participated in the Fall 2015 seminar developed a conceptual framework for the exhibition, helped select objects to study within that framework, and wrote the essays that appear in the catalogue.

Distributed by Yale University Press.\r\nGrenville L. Winthrop (1864–1943) was a lawyer and banker, but his true passion was collecting art. He had the resources, the intuition, and the talented advisers to help him create a collection that is distinct in its depth, breadth, and quality. The Winthrop Collection of French, British, and American art includes the best group of Delacroix and Ingres drawings outside of France, the most signiﬁcant group of Pre-Raphaelite paintings outside of Britain, and a world-renowned collection of Sargent watercolors.\r\nSome seventy paintings and twice as many drawings and watercolors by more than ﬁfty French, British, and American artists are featured in this selection from the legendary Winthrop Collection, bequeathed to the Fogg Museum in 1943. Included are masterpieces by David, Ingres, Géricault, Chassériau, and Moreau; Blake, Rossetti, and Burne-Jones; and Homer, Sargent, and Whistler. They are discussed in the catalogue by more than sixty authors, all of whom are leading authorities in their various ﬁelds.\r\nThis book is the catalogue for an exhibition held at the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Lyon, France, March 15–26, 2003; the National Gallery, London, June 25–September 14, 2003; and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, October 20, 2003–January 25, 2004.\r\nStephan Wolohojian is curator in the Department of Paintings, Sculpture, and Decorative Arts at the Fogg Museum.","title":"A Private Passion: 19th-Century Paintings and Drawings from the Grenville L.
